 * A distributed maze solver. The only argument for this program is to take the file name of a maze.
 *
 * A maze is a rectangular field of square boxes. These boxes have four sides
 * which are either open or blocked by a wall. One solution to the maze is to have
 * a series of connected squares such that a path runs from the entrance of the maze to the exit,
 * without the path being obstructed by a wall. The entrance is always on the north-west edge of
 * the maze, and the exit is on the south-east edge of the maze.

 * absence of walls. For an explanation of why this works, see the provided
